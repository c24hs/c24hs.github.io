		Hello, world! Welcome to my journal. This is where I'll write about my adventures in Compsci 1:)

		So far compsci 1 has been pretty fun! I already have a little experience with javascript and html, so it’s been great to review but also learn some more in class! My labs with Molly so far have been pretty fun, especially when we finished my first codesketch! It was really satisfying to see everything come together. My plans for future projects are to learn how to add a menu bar so I can put it onto the Black is King website, and then make picture pages for each song! I’m really excited to finally be able to use the costume pictures I spent hours taking, especially since the costumes are drop dead gorgeous.

		I put my website online! Yay! Unfortunately, I haven’t figured out how to put the changes I make in sublime text online yet. I tried committing in terminal, but it does not seem to be changing. It’s starting to take shape, though.

		I can’t wait for Thanksgiving! I’ve been leafing through cookbooks day after day looking for the perfect recipe for this year’s small thanksgiving with just my immediate family. Until then, though, I will be focusing on finishing all of my work. This week’s assignment is to use a javascript function to do something cool, which is a pretty broad assignment! I think I’m going to use an event listener to alert the user when they click where they should click to go to the other page. It sounds confusing when I write it down, but I think it’ll come together. Wish me luck!

		I just added links to all of my projects, so that’s exciting! I’m realizing now that all of my entries start with exclamation marks, but that’s probably because I’m a very enthusiastic person. It’s cool to see my website growing, especially now that I’m adding more to each section. I’m very ready for break (only three classes to go). Happy Thanksgiving!

		I’m not sure what I’m going to do for this week’s codesketch yet, but I’m glad my projects page is really starting to fill up. This is going to be a pretty stressful week, but the holidays are starting soon! I’ve been blasting my amazing holiday playlist, so that’s put me in a somewhat better mood. Last week we worked on for loops in javascript, which is actually pretty similar, or maybe the same, to for loops in java. I’m not sure if I’ll be allowed to do this, but instead of a codesketch this week I think I will update my travel page.

		It’s been a minute! Since I’ve last written, I’ve learned how to use slack, added pictures to the Spain section of my travel page (my favorite one is the soccer cheetos), and finally figured out event listeners. I have a lot of work to do this week, but I’m hoping I’ll feel a lot better once I get started. I’m feeling good about my compsci position, though, because I’ve already watched all three refresher videos, and I’m pretty good at updating my website on terminal. I’m excited to see what we will do tomorrow in class!

		This weekend I started working on my movie data project! It’s actually going pretty well so far! I’ve color coded almost all of the movies in my genre section. There are three movies that I seem to be missing, so I’m going to go through my list and see which one’s I’m missing. I set up my “where I streamed them” section but have not put in the correct data. I will probably go through and check where I streamed everything this weekend. Today in class we made goals for the last 6 weeks of class. I can’t believe we’re already almost done; it seems like just yesterday I was learning how to make an html page! Before we end, I want to add more pictures to my travel section, finish my movie project, and make a codesketch that uses randomization and arrays.

		I can’t believe I have already finished compsci 1. I know this is such a cliché, but it really does feel like I just started coding yesterday! I’m so proud of all the progress my code has made and all the projects I worked on throughout the year. When I was making my final presentation, I realized how much movies have been the driving force behind a lot of my projects this year. It has inspired me to watch more movies over spring break, so I’m compiling a list. I can’t wait to see what I’ll do next in compsci next year!
