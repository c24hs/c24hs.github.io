		Hello, world! Welcome to my journal. This is where I'll write about my adventures in Compsci 1:)

<!-- how do I put text on a separate line? How do I indent?-->

		So far compsci 1 has been pretty fun! I already have a little experience with javascript and html, so it’s been great to review but also learn some more in class! My labs with Molly so far have been pretty fun, especially when we finished my first codesketch! It was really satisfying to see everything come together. My plans for future projects are to learn how to add a menu bar so I can put it onto the Black is King website, and then make picture pages for each song! I’m really excited to finally be able to use the costume pictures I spent hours taking, especially since the costumes are drop dead gorgeous.

		I put my website online! Yay! Unfortunately, I haven’t figured out how to put the changes I make in sublime text online yet. I tried committing in terminal, but it does not seem to be changing. It’s starting to take shape, though.

		I can’t wait for Thanksgiving! I’ve been leafing through cookbooks day after day looking for the perfect recipe for this year’s small thanksgiving with just my immediate family. Until then, though, I will be focusing on finishing all of my work. This week’s assignment is to use a javascript function to do something cool, which is a pretty broad assignment! I think I’m going to use an event listener to alert the user when they click where they should click to go to the other page. It sounds confusing when I write it down, but I think it’ll come together. Wish me luck!
